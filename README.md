# bates_galaxies_lab

This repository includes code developed by members of the Bates
Galaxies Lab (sometimes called "the bagel," which in principle could
stand for Bates Astrophysics Galaxy Evolution Lab) at Bates College in
Lewiston, Maine.  As of the Fall 2016 semester, current lab members
include Aleks Diamond-Stanic (Assistant Professor of Physics and
Astronomy), Sophia Gottlieb (senior physics major, class of 2017), and
Joshua Rinua (senior physics major, class of 2017).

# bgl_aper_phot.py

This code makes "postage stamp" visualizations of a galaxy in three
different filters, performs aperture photometry on each image, and
plots the flux (energy/area/time) in circular apertures centered on
the galaxy.
